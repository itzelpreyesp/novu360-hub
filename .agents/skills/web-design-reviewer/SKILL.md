description: 'This skill enables visual inspection of websites running locally or remotely to identify and fix design issues. Triggers on requests like "review website design", "check the UI", "fix the layout", "find design problems". Detects issues with responsive design, accessibility, visual consistency, and layout breakage, then performs fixes at the source code level.'
---

This skill enables visual inspection and validation of website design quality, identifying and fixing issues at the source code level.

- Static sites (HTML/CSS/JS)
- SPA frameworks such as React / Vue / Angular / Svelte
- Full-stack frameworks such as Next.js / Nuxt / SvelteKit
- CMS platforms such as WordPress / Drupal
- Any other web application

1. **Target website must be running**
   - Local development server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
   - Staging environment
   - Production environment (for read-only reviews)

2. **Browser automation must be available**
   - Screenshot capture
   - Page navigation
   - DOM information retrieval

3. **Access to source code (when making fixes)**
   - Project must exist within the workspace

### 1.1 URL Confirmation
If the URL is not provided, ask the user:

> Please provide the URL of the website to review (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)

### 1.2 Understanding Project Structure
When making fixes, gather the following information:

| Item | Example Question |
|------|------------------|
| Framework | Are you using React / Vue / Next.js, etc.? |
| Styling Method | CSS / SCSS / Tailwind / CSS-in-JS, etc. |
| Source Location | Where are style files and components located? |
| Review Scope | Specific pages only or entire site? |

### 1.3 Automatic Project Detection
Attempt automatic detection from files in the workspace:

```
Detection targets:
├── package.json     → Framework and dependencies
├── tsconfig.json    → TypeScript usage
├── tailwind.config  → Tailwind CSS
├── next.config      → Next.js
├── vite.config      → Vite
├── nuxt.config      → Nuxt
└── src/ or app/     → Source directory
```

### 1.4 Identifying Styling Method
| Method | Detection | Edit Target |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Pure CSS | `*.css` files | Global CSS or component CSS |
| SCSS/Sass | `*.scss`, `*.sass` | SCSS files |
| CSS Modules | `*.module.css` | Module CSS files |
| Tailwind CSS | `tailwind.config.*` | className in components |
| styled-components | `styled.` in code | JS/TS files |
| Emotion | `@emotion/` imports | JS/TS files |
| CSS-in-JS (other) | Inline styles | JS/TS files |

### 2.1 Page Traversal
1. Navigate to the specified URL
2. Capture screenshots
3. Retrieve DOM structure/snapshot (if possible)
4. If additional pages exist, traverse through navigation

### 2.2 Inspection Items
#### Layout Issues

| Issue | Description | Severity |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Element Overflow | Content overflows from parent element or viewport | High |
| Element Overlap | Unintended overlapping of elements | High |
| Alignment Issues | Grid or flex alignment problems | Medium |
| Inconsistent Spacing | Padding/margin inconsistencies | Medium |
| Text Clipping | Long text not handled properly | Medium |

#### Responsive Issues

| Issue | Description | Severity |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Non-mobile Friendly | Layout breaks on small screens | High |
| Breakpoint Issues | Unnatural transitions when screen size changes | Medium |
| Touch Targets | Buttons too small on mobile | Medium |

#### Accessibility Issues

| Issue | Description | Severity |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Insufficient Contrast | Low contrast ratio between text and background | High |
| No Focus State | Cannot determine state during keyboard navigation | High |
| Missing alt Text | No alternative text for images | Medium |

#### Visual Consistency

| Issue | Description | Severity |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Font Inconsistency | Mixed font families | Medium |
| Color Inconsistency | Non-unified brand colors | Medium |
| Spacing Inconsistency | Non-uniform spacing between similar elements | Low |

### 2.3 Viewport Testing (Responsive)
Test at the following viewports:

| Name | Width | Representative Device |
|------|-------|----------------------|
| Mobile | 375px | iPhone SE/12 mini |
| Tablet | 768px | iPad |
| Desktop | 1280px | Standard PC |
| Wide | 1920px | Large display |

### 3.1 Issue Prioritization

- **P1**: Fix Immediately (Layout issues affecting functionality)
- **P2**: Fix Next (Visual issues degrading UX)
- **P3**: Fix If Possible (Minor visual inconsistencies)

### 3.2 Identifying Source Files
Identify source files from problematic elements:

1. **Selector-based Search**
   - Search codebase by class name or ID
   - Explore style definitions with `grep_search`

2. **Component-based Search**
   - Identify components from element text or structure
   - Explore related files with `semantic_search`

3. **File Pattern Filtering**
   ```
   Style files: src/**/*.css, styles/**/*
   Components: src/components/**/*
   Pages: src/pages/**, app/**
   ```

### 3.3 Fix Principles

1. **Minimal Changes**: Only make the minimum changes necessary to resolve the issue
2. **Respect Existing Patterns**: Follow existing code style in the project
3. **Avoid Breaking Changes**: Be careful not to affect other areas
4. **Add Comments**: Add comments to explain the reason for fixes where appropriate

---

### 4.1 Post-fix Confirmation
1. Reload browser (or wait for development server HMR)
2. Capture screenshots of fixed areas
3. Compare before and after

### 4.2 Regression Testing
- Verify that fixes haven't affected other areas
- Confirm responsive display is not broken

### 4.3 Iteration Decision
**Iteration Limit**: If more than 3 fix attempts are needed for a specific issue, consult the user

---

### DO (Recommended)
- ✅ Always save screenshots before making fixes
- ✅ Fix one issue at a time and verify each
- ✅ Follow the project's existing code style
- ✅ Confirm with user before major changes
- ✅ Document fix details thoroughly

### DON'T (Not Recommended)
- ❌ Large-scale refactoring without confirmation
- ❌ Ignoring design systems or brand guidelines
- ❌ Fixes that ignore performance
- ❌ Fixing multiple issues at once (difficult to verify)
